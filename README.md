# Unintended consequences due to employment guarantee
Employment guarantee programs intend to provide employment to the unskilled rural population to tide over consumption shocks encountered during agricultural cycles. Using National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), the largest workfare program in the world as background, we show that the program led to significant reduction of consumption for landowning agricultural households. Due to increased cost of agriculture induced by crowding out of agricultural labor, we show that this effect is more pronounced during non-dry seasons and in districts where the program intensity is higher. We find that this decrease in consumption is a function of land size where small farmers are affected more compared to the large farmers.

1 - NSSO rounds 61-66 CE working.do
The .do file extracts data from rounds 61 to 66 NSSO datasets and creates consumption variables.
It outputs consumption variables like expenditures on basic food, luxury food, intoxicants, durable goods, minor durable goods, gold and monthly per capita expenditure.
It then analyses the impact of 3-phase NREGA on the landed agriclutural households vis-a-vis landless casual laborers.
